# NUGURI_HCI
We are Team HCI, a group of third-year students from the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Hanyang University ERICA.
We are developing an algorithm and web platform that converts clothing images into tactile information to assist visually impaired individuals with online clothing shopping. This project aims to enhance the shopping experience by enabling visually impaired users to perceive the shape and texture of clothing through tactile feedback.
